It has become a common practice for people to read online opinions/reviews for different purposes. For example, if one wants to buy a product, one typically goes to a review site (e.g., amazon.com) to read some reviews of the product. If most reviews are positive, one is likely to buy the product. If most reviews are negative, one will almost certainly not buy it. Positive opinions can result in significant financial gains and/or fames for busineses, organizations and individuals. This, unfortunately, gives strong incentives for opinion spamming.

We selected three models, LSTB, Bret and LR, for training and comparison respectively.

By implementing data analysis, data cleaning, preprocessing, feature extraction and modeling, we successfully trained spam detection models with a compatible performance with SOTA results. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of machine learning in finding linguistic patterns and the ability to contribute to the human commercial society.
