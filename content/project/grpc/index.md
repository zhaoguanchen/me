# JavaFX Project

This is a Lab Resource Sharing System that was developed with JavaFX.

## Tech Stack

**Framework**

We choose [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/) to develop this desktop application. JavaFX is an open-source, next-generation client application platform for desktop, mobile, and embedded systems built on Java.

**Database**

MySQL (RDS on AWS)

## How to run

The recommand IDE is **IntelliJ IDEA**.

### 1. Set JDK 11

Go to File -> Project Structure -> Project, and set the project SDK to 11. You can also set the language level to 11.

### 2. Create a library

Go to File -> Project Structure -> Libraries and add the libs/ as a library to the project.

### 3. Add VM options

Go to Preferences (File -> Settings) -> Appearance & Behavior -> Path Variables, define the name of the variable as PATH_TO_FX, browse to the lib folder of the `/libs` to set its value, and click apply.  Also, you can download the latest version of `JavaFX` and redefine the variable path.

  

click on Run -> Edit Configurations... and add VM options:

```
--module-path ${PATH_TO_FX} --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml
```

### 4. Modify Database Connection

The path that saves the database information is `gczhao/database/DatabaseHandler.java`. Remember to replace these settings with your database information.

### 5. Execute SQL Statement

The script is located at `sql/script.sql`, which includes DDL and DML.

### 6. Run the project

Click Run -> Run... to run the project, now it should work fine.
