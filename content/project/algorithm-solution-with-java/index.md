This project is a collection of problem solutions to the leetcode algorithm implemented in Java.

The project is still improving. For details, please click [here](https://github.com/zhaoguanchen/leetcode).

The project is divided into two parts: `structure` and `solution`. The `structure` package contains the data structure required for the question, such as `TreeNode` for the binary tree question, `ListNode` for the linked list question, etc. The `solution` package contains the leetcode algorithm problems, packaged by solution type.
